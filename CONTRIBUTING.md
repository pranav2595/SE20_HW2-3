## How Can I Contribute? 
### Bug Reporting
You can contribute by reporting bugs. Before doing this, first check whether the bug has been reported. The bugs are tracked in Github Issues. Determine which repository the bug exists, then create an issue on that repository and provide the necessary information by filling out the template. Brief summary of your desktop environment you are using, and an additional screenshot (or short video) of the bug/error would also be very helpful. 

### Enhancement Suggestion
Enhancement suggestions are also done through Github Issues. Again, first check whether there is an existing suggestion that conflicts with yours. If there are no existing enhancement suggestions, decide which repository your enhancement suggestion is related to, and create a new issue.
